title: Introduction for Server Owners

## What is MinecraftAuthentication?

MinecraftAuthentication allows you, as a server owner, to add external restrictions to joining your Minecraft Server. If you're a content creator, you can restrict access to Twitch subscribers, or YouTube members of a specific tier, or just any of them. You can also restrict based on discord servers/roles, or Patreon Tiers. A full list of supported services can be found in the [Supported Services](/owners/supported-services) section.

## Why should I use MinecraftAuthentication?
MinecraftAuthentication provides a way to manage who can join your server based on their support for your content. This can help you build a community of supporters and only provide access to those who contribute to your work. It also allows you to easily manage access without needing complex plugins or manual checks. You know the feeling, manually going through support tickets or applications and doing <code>/whitelist add</code> commands? This is a thing of the past with MinecraftAuthentication.

## How does it work?
MinecraftAuthentication works by integrating with various platforms to verify a user's support status. When a player attempts to join your server, the plugin checks their linked platforms against our API to determine if they meet the criteria you've set. Players must link their accounts on the [MinecraftAuthentication website](https://minecraftauth.me) before joining; if they haven't, the default kick message will instruct them to do so. If they meet your criteria, they are allowed to join; if not, they are denied access with a customizable message.
